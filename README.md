Welcome!

My name is Nicolas Petelo. This is my submission for our first challenge, which focuses on refactoring. Our task was to take some starter code and refactor it so that certain requirements were met. In this repository are the .html and .css files that create a home page for the company Horiseon.

Cheers.
